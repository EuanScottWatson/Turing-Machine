# Turing Machine
Turing machines were a part of my (COMP50003) Models of Computation module at Imperial and as I am starting more Java tutoring in the new year I thought I'd brush up with a small turing machine simulator.

## Examples
There are 5 examples I've coded:
1. BinaryIncrement - increments a given binary string
2. DivisibleByThree - checks if a given binary string is divisible by 3
3. ThreeEqualLengths - regex checker for a string in the form: "a^(n)b^(n)c^(n)"
4. ThreeStateBusyBeaver - the 3-state busy beaver TM
5. FourStateBusyBeaver - the 4-state busy beaver TM

With each example, you can also add the parameter `detailed=true` which will show the tape at each step of the program.
